;;; Commentary:

;; Functions for using astyle in Emacs.

;;; Installation:

;; Make sure to place `astyle-utils.el' somewhere in the load-path and
;; add `(require 'astyle-utils)' to init file.

;;; Code:

(defvar astyle-command "astyle --style=bsd -T8 -f -p -H -U -e")

;; The meaning of parameters are:

;; --indent=force-tab=#  OR  -T#
;; Indent using tab characters, assuming that each
;; indent is # spaces long. Force tabs to be used in areas
;; AStyle would prefer to use spaces.

;; --break-blocks  OR  -f
;; Insert empty lines around unrelated blocks, labels, classes, ...

;; --pad-oper  OR  -p
;; Insert space padding around operators.

;; --pad-header  OR  -H
;; Insert space padding after paren headers (e.g. 'if', 'for'...).

;; --unpad-paren  OR  -U
;; Remove unnecessary space padding around parenthesis. This
;; can be used in combination with the 'pad' options above.

;; --break-elseifs  OR  -e
;; Break 'else if()' statements into two different lines.
